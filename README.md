# Weather Data Analysis

## 📌 Problem Statement
This document presents an analysis of weather data. The dataset consists of **temperature, rainfall, and humidity** recorded over time. The objective is to apply data analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights from the given data.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset provided contains the following columns:
- **Date**: The recorded date.
- **Temperature (°C)**: Daily recorded temperature.
- **Rainfall (mm)**: Amount of rainfall.
- **Humidity (%)**: Humidity levels recorded.

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
1. To analyze trends in temperature, rainfall, and humidity over time.
2. To understand the distribution of weather parameters.
3. To identify correlations between different weather factors.
4. To visualize key weather patterns using appropriate plots.

## 🚀 Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For data visualization
- **NumPy** – For numerical operations

## 📊 Analysis Performed
1. **Time Series Analysis** – To study variations in temperature, rainfall, and humidity.
2. **Histograms** – To visualize the frequency distribution of weather parameters.
3. **Box Plots** – To identify data outliers and variations.
4. **Correlation Heatmap** – To analyze relationships between variables.
5. **Scatter Plots & Pair Plots** – To explore interactions between weather parameters.

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Temperature and humidity** exhibit a positive correlation.
- **Rainfall data** shows significant variations, indicating seasonal effects.
- **Outliers** are observed in the rainfall data, possibly due to extreme weather events.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The analysis effectively highlights weather trends and interdependencies among parameters. Understanding such data is crucial for weather forecasting, environmental research, and planning.
